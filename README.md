# Image Steganography

It means hiding data in an image. This is possible because images are constituted of pixels. Each pixel can be represented as bits.
The lower bits don't hold a lot of detail so they can be used to hide our data (by replacing them with corresponding bits of data).
Since most of the information is contained in MSBs (due to their higher weights), the resulting image is very similar to the human eye.
